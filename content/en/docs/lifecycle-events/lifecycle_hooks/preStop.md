# PreStop Hook

The PreStop hook is a special lifecycle hook that runs a command or sends an HTTP request before the container is terminated.When a preStop hook is defined on a container, the specified command will execute before the container is shut down. This behavior allows the container to perform any necessary cleanup or finalization tasks.

# Overview of Lifecycle Hooks

In Kubernetes, provide a way to trigger specific actions at crucial stages of a container's life. These hooks can be particularly useful for handling tasks such as performing cleanups just before the container shuts down or initiating processes right after it starts.

## Types of Lifecycle Hooks

Kubernetes provides two main types of lifecycle hooks:

- [PreStop Hook](./PreStop.md)
  - This hook runs a command or sends an HTTP request right before the container is terminated, allowing you to execute graceful shutdown steps.
  
- [PostStart Hook](./PostStart.md)
  - This hook allows you to trigger a command or send an HTTP request immediately after the container starts, perfect for setting up resources or performing initialization tasks.

Both hooks give you more control over your containerâ€™s behavior at critical points during its lifecycle, helping you manage Pod operations more efficiently.

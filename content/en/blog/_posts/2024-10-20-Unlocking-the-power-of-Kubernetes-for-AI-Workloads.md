As developers who rely on Kubernetes, we're always looking for ways to leverage the project’s features to tackle new challenges. One area that's been gaining traction is running AI workloads on Kubernetes clusters.

I recently presented on this topic at KubeCon China. In this blog post, I’ll use that presentation content to explore why Kubernetes is a great choice for AI applications. We’ll cover the challenges users might face along the way and share best practices for GPU utilization and resource management. Finally, we’ll delve into special considerations like integrating popular AI tools, enhancing security, and meeting performance requirements through distributed computing.

## Why Kubernetes Is Great for Running AI Workloads

Kubernetes is great for managing containerized applications across multiple environments, whether on-premises, in the cloud, or in hybrid setups. This portability ensures that AI workloads can run consistently, regardless of the underlying infrastructure. Plus, Kubernetes has the ability to scale pods and nodes dynamically. That means it can handle the computational demands of AI training and inference tasks effectively, provided it’s managed correctly.

Efficient resource management is very important for AI workloads, as costs for CPU, GPU, and memory resources can quickly escalate at scale. Kubernetes lets developers fine-tune resource allocation, ensuring that applications use what they need and nothing more. This optimization not only improves performance but also helps control costs. All this means that running AI workloads can be expensive, so using Kubernetes to control costs through dynamic scaling can help reduce over-provisioning.

Of course, AI workloads can be unpredictable. You might need to scale up resources during peak training times and scale down when not needed. The dynamic resource scaling capabilities of Kubernetes make it easy to automate the adjustment of these fluctuations, optimizing performance without manual intervention.

Additionally, training AI models can require specialized hardware (GPUs, TPUs). Kubernetes can simplify scheduling and managing these resources. With device plugins and operators provided by GPU vendors like NVIDIA, Kubernetes can automatically discover and allocate GPUs to your workloads, optimizing utilization and simplifying management.

Kubernetes also boasts an extensive ecosystem of open-source tools and frameworks. Popular AI frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and NVIDIA's NeMo integrate with Kubernetes, reducing the learning curve. Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) allow you to extend Kubernetes capabilities to meet the needs of AI workloads.

## Challenges of Running AI Workloads on Kubernetes

Deploying AI workloads on Kubernetes isn't without its hurdles. Setting up the necessary infrastructure, especially for GPU management, can get complicated, and Kubernetes is already pretty complex. Configuring device plugins, installing drivers, and ensuring compatibility with your chosen AI frameworks can all take time. Let’s break it down.

First off, for small projects or applications requiring real-time inference with ultra-low latency, Kubernetes might be overkill. The overhead of managing a cluster could outweigh the benefits, and simpler solutions might be more appropriate.

But if it’s the right way to go, keep in mind that different cloud providers offer different GPU instance types and pricing structures. Navigating these options to optimize costs can get frustrating. A multicloud strategy might be necessary to leverage the best offerings from each provider, but this adds complexity to your deployment and management processes.

Finally, performance and latency are critical considerations for end user experience. Running AI workloads on clusters that are geographically distant from end users can introduce latency issues and degrade the user experience. There's a growing need for distributed clusters positioned closer to users to provide faster response times and improved performance.

## Best Practices for GPU Utilization and Resource Management

Leverage the horizontal and vertical pod autoscaling capabilities of Kubernetes to adjust resources based on demand is job one for any developer using Kubernetes to manage AI workloads. It ensures that your AI workloads have the necessary resources during peak times without wasting them when demand is low.

Use GPU operators and automated node labeling to simplify GPU management. NVIDIA's GPU Operator, for example, automates the provisioning and management of all NVIDIA software components needed to run GPU-accelerated Kubernetes workloads. Also, take advantage of features like NVIDIA's Multi-Instance GPU (MIG), which allows a single GPU to be partitioned into multiple instances. This maximizes resource utilization by enabling multiple workloads to share a single GPU efficiently.

Utilize the scheduling capabilities in Kubernetes to assign workloads to nodes with available GPU resources, and define resource requests and limits in your pod specifications to make sure your applications are scheduled the way you want them.

Also keep in mind when selecting GPUs that both computational power and VRAM are important variables. Ensure that the GPUs have enough memory to handle models and datasets. This is especially important for training large models or processing high-resolution images.

## Special Considerations for Running AI Workloads on Kubernetes

Finally, here are a few things to keep in mind as you’re building out a Kubernetes cluster strategy in support of AI workloads.

### Integration with Popular AI Tools

Ensure that your Kubernetes environment is compatible with the AI frameworks you plan to use. Leverage container images provided by each of these frameworks, which are often optimized for GPU acceleration and Kubernetes deployment. Use CRDs to extend Kubernetes functionality to meet the specific needs of your AI workloads. CRDs can help manage specialized resources and provide custom scheduling and orchestration logic.

### Security Measures

You’ll need to implement network policies, firewalls, and load balancers to secure your Kubernetes clusters. Control inbound and outbound traffic to protect your AI workloads from unauthorized access.

A best practice is to use role-based access control (RBAC) and authentication mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users and services can interact with your clusters. And of course you’ll need to regularly update and patch your clusters to mitigate vulnerabilities.

### Meeting Performance and Latency Requirements

Deploying Kubernetes clusters at the edge, closer to where data is generated and consumed, reduces latency and can improve the performance of real-time AI applications. One thing to consider is a distributed cloud strategy in which you deploy coordinated clusters across multiple geographic regions. Tools like federation or service meshes can help manage and synchronize workloads.

This opens the door to leveraging multiple cloud providers to gain benefits like optimizing for cost, performance, and resource availability. Kubernetes is portable by design, making it feasible to manage workloads across different environments.

## A Challenge to the Kubernetes Community

Running AI workloads on Kubernetes can unlock a new level of scalability, flexibility, and efficiency for any organization running inference at scale. Sure, there are challenges to overcome, but the benefits can outweigh the complexities. As members of the Kubernetes community, we're in a unique position to push the boundaries of what's possible with AI.
